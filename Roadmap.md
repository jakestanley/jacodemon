# In progress
- Replay buffer naming

# Planned

- Enemies count in map picker
- In depth analysis, which maps were easy? How many attempts before you completed a map for the first time?
- Multiple configs
	- Should be able to select from multiple configurations for each port, maybe by providing an array of paths?
- WAD locations and PWAD search (uses WAD.TXT if available)
- WADSeeker integration
- Download map? list archive?
- Add FINISHED to auto-records output file rename
- Option to delete recording instead of saving
