# Planned

- Enemies count in map picker
- In depth analysis, which maps were easy? How many attempts before you completed a map for the first time?
- Multiple configs
	- Should be able to select from multiple configurations for each port, maybe by providing an array of paths?
- WAD locations and PWAD search (uses WAD.TXT if available)
- WADSeeker integration
- Download map? list archive?

# Bugs

- 2023-08-03: If already recording, starting an auto record session will result in a None file name error
- 2023-08-03: Selecting `Last` option from GUI (not program args) does not work. `Last` might actually be broken tbf
